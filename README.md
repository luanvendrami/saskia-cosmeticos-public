## 🌟 Project Description

Saskia Cosmetics is an e-commerce platform designed for selling feminine beauty products. The site was specifically created for quick sales, without the need for a traditional checkout process. Instead, purchases are made directly through WhatsApp, and products are sent to customers manually. This approach was requested by the client as they do not have an inventory to support a full-fledged e-commerce operation. 

However, the project is designed with flexibility in mind and is fully prepared to scale into a nationwide e-commerce platform if requested by the client in the future. The site is ready for future expansion, and the infrastructure supports a transition to a larger, more traditional e-commerce model at any time.

## 🚀 Overview

Saskia Cosmetics is an e-commerce platform developed with cutting-edge web technologies, offering a smooth and pleasant shopping experience for customers.
